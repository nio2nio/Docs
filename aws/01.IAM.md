### IAM Policy
+ An IAM policy is **a rule** or **set of rules** defining the operations allowed/denied to be performed on an AWS resource.
+ Policies can be granted in a number of ways:
  + Attaching a **managed policy**. AWS provides a list of pre-defined policies such as AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess.
  + Attaching an inline policy. An inline policy is a custom policy created by hand.
  + Adding the user to a group that has appropriate permission policies attached.
  + Cloning the permission of an existing IAM user.
+ Examples
  + Grants all operations to all S3 buckets.
```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": {
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Action": "s3:*",
    "Resource": "*"
  }
}
```
  + Only allowing retrieval of files prefixed by the string Bobs- in the bucket called Hello-bucket.  
```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": {
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Action": ["s3:GetObject"],
    "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::Hello-bucket/*",
    "Condition": {"StringEquals": {"s3:prefix": "Bobs-"}}
}
```

### IAM Policy
+ An IAM policy is **a rule** or **set of rules** defining the operations allowed/denied to be performed on an AWS resource.
+ Policies can be granted in a number of ways:
  + Attaching a **managed policy**. AWS provides a list of pre-defined policies such as AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess.
  + Attaching an inline policy. An inline policy is a custom policy created by hand.
  + Adding the user to a group that has appropriate permission policies attached.
  + Cloning the permission of an existing IAM user.
